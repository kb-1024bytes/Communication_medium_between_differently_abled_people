Communication medium for differently abled people.
Problem Definition:
In this ever-developing human society with communication being the most important 
aspect of development, evolution, and unity, there is a need of communication between 
visually challenged people and people who cannot speak. Their communication is not 
possible just by listening and speaking. A mute person cannot speak but can 
communicate via sign language which is not possible for a blind person to see.

To build a suitable device that solves this problem without interference of a translator.

Aims and Objectives:
To enable communication medium between a mute and a blind person. 

Benefits:
● Helps create a healthy social environment.
● Serves as replacement for a human translator.
● Increased social interaction between differently abled people.
● Useful for the development of society.
● Affordable work product.
● Can also be improvised to convert sign language to audio.

Proposed Plan of Work:
1. Create an image processing application that will detect sign language.
2. Convert the sign language to text.
3. Convert text to Braille form.
4. Build an automatic Braille device to display text in Braille form using ArduinoUno.
5. Testing and debugging the developed software

Methodology:
The project is based on image processing and Internet of Things (IoT), it involves 3 parts
1. Sign detection
• Detect sign language in MATLAB/OpenCV.
2. Conversion:
● Sign to text
This part will convert the processed image to text.
● Text to Braille:
This part will give the input to Arduino in alphabets form and 
Arduino will convert the alphabets to Braille language.
 3. Hardware implementation:
• This requires connecting the image capturing device, Arduino Uno 
and Braille language display.
Technology:
Back End:
● MATLAB, OpenCV.
● Internet of Things (Arduino Uno).
● Python 3, C, C++.
● TensorFlow.
● Keras.
Front End: 
• Braille device.
• MATLAB / OpenCV UI
